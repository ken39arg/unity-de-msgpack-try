# MessagePack for Unity

## What is it?

This is MessagePack serialization/deserialization for Unity (or Unity Pro.)

This library is based on Kazuki's MessagePack for C#
(not the current official for CLI, because it depends on .NET framework 4.0.) 

## Install

To install this, copy files in src to Assets folder in your project.
